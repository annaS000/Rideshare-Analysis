# **PyBer Rideshare Analysis**

## **Overview**
> PyBer is a ride-sharing app that has asked us to perform an analysis on some data. By using `Pandas` and `Matplotlib`, we must create a summary DataFrame of the [ride-sharing data](https://github.com/annaS000/Rideshare-Analysis/tree/main/Resources) and a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. After collecting our results, we must provide written report that summarizes the differences in our findings by city type and ultimately give business reccomendations for PyBer.

## **Results**
![ride date](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/annaS000/Rideshare-Analysis/main/Resources/ride_data_by_city_type.png)
> Here we can see the differences in ride-sharing data for Rural, Suburban, and Urban areas. **Urban areas** have the most rides, drivers, and the lowest rates for ride fares. **Rural areas** have the least amount of rides and drivers and the most expensive ride fares.  **Suburban areas** don't have as many rides or drivers as Urban places but are more successful than Rural places. and has the mid-range price out of the three types for ride fares. In regards to the **Total Fares**, Urban cities received about double the amount of fares compared to Suburban cities and almost 10 times more than Rural cities.

![data by week](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/annaS000/Rideshare-Analysis/main/analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png)
> This line graph displays the total fares per week for each city between the months of January and April. **Urban areas** saw highs and lows in Total Fares during the month of March. **Suburban** and **Rural areas** did not experience many changes throughout the given months except for a few subtle peaks and dips. We can see all city types had a spike in Total Fare towards the end of February.

## **Summary**

After reviewing the information that was extracted from the ride-sharing data, a few things can be considered:
1. **Urban areas** are, usually, densely populated which increases the demand for public transportation. Therefore needing more drivers and lower rates to accommodate for the amount of people that need rides. The line chart shows us the peaks in total fare
    <br/>

2. **Rural areas** had less rides and drivers with higher fares to make up for the lack of demand in this service. This makes sense because Rural areas have more spread out land and more people most likely own their own vehicles. If we look at our line graph, we can see a few spikes in total fare during some weeks. The biggest spikes occur in the last week in February and the first week in April. During the weeks with more requests for rides, the drivers can consider raising their fares to increase their profit. Conversely, we can see that mid-February, most of March, and the end of April experience lulls in total fare. If these Rural areas are looking to icrease the frequency of rides during those times, it is possible that lowering their prices can influence more people to pay for this service in those weeks.

3. **Suburban areas** had less rides and drivers than Urban areas but more than Rural areas
