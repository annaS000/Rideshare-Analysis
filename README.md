# **PyBer Rideshare Analysis**

## **Overview**
> By using Pandas, we must create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

> Here we can see the differences in ride-sharing data for Rural, Suburban, and Urban areas. **Urban areas** have the most rides, drivers, and the lowest rates for ride fares. **Rural areas** have the least amount of rides and drivers and the most expensive ride fares.  **Suburban areas** don't have as many rides or drivers as Urban places but are more successful than Rural places. and has the mid-range price out of the three types for ride fares.

## **Summary**

After reviewing the information that was extracted from the ride-sharing data, a few things can be considered:
1. Urban areas are, usually, densely populated which increases the demand for public transportation. It is common for people who live in urban don't often own their own vehicle in big cities because it is an extra expense, there may be issues with parking, and . Therefore needing more drivers and lower rates to accommodate for the amount of people that need rides.
2. This makes sense because Rural areas have more spread out land and more people most likely own their own vehicles. To make up for the lack of rides needed in these areas, the ride fares are higher. If Rural areas are looking to icrease their frequency of rides, lowering their prices can allow more people to be willing to pay for the ride.
3. Suburban areas.
